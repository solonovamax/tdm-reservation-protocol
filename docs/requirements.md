# Goals and Requirements for a Technical Solution

## Goals

To ensure that all users without discrimination will be able to reserve TDM Rights, the solution shall:

1. Rely on open standards and be interoperable.
1. Rely on tools and formats widely supported by publishers and TDM Actors.
1. Minimize economic and technical barriers to implementation.

TDM and content indexing for search and discovery have different usage purposes. Therefore a prerequisite for any technical solutions that may be explored is that such solution shall enable rightsholders to reserve TDM Rights without affecting access to other services such as content indexing and listing by search engines, nor affect content ranking in search pages results. 

## Core requirements

The technical specification shall:

1. Specify how a rightsholder can declare the reservation of TDM Rights on each individual Web resource he controls.
1. Specify how a rightsholder can indicate the location of human readable information indicating how to apply for a TDM License.
1. Specify how a rightsholder can indicate the location of a TDM Policy associated with each individual Web resource he controls.
1. Specify a machine-readable format for TDM Policies. 

## Additional Requirements

Advanced user needs or sector specific practices may imply additional requirements. The additional features resulting from these additional requirements will not replace the core features resulting from core requirements, but will complement them.
